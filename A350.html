    <h2>Role: Wide-body jet airliner</h2>
    <h3>National origin: Multinational</h3>
    <h4>Manufacturer: Airbus</h4>
    <h5>First flight: 14 June 2013</h5>
    <h6>Introduction: 15 January 2015 with Qatar Airways</h6>

    <p>
        The Airbus A350 is a long-range, wide-body jet airliner developed by Airbus. The first A350 design proposed by Airbus in 2004, in response to the Boeing 
        787 Dreamliner, would have been a development of the A330 with composite wings and new engines. As market support was inadequate, in 2006, Airbus
        switched to a clean-sheet "XWB" (eXtra Wide Body) design, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent XWB turbofan engines. The prototype first flew on 14 June 2013
        from Toulouse in France. Type certification from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) was obtained in September 2014, followed by certification
        from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) two months later.

    The A350 is the first Airbus aircraft largely made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer. <br> It has a new fuselage designed around a nine-abreast economy cross-
    section, up from the eight-abreast A330/A340. It has a common type rating with the A330. The airliner has two variants: the A350-900 typically carries 300 to
    350 passengers over a 15,000-kilometre (8,100-nautical-mile) range, and has a 280-tonne (617,300-pound) maximum take-off weight (MTOW); the longer
    A350-1000 accommodates 350 to 410 passengers and has a maximum range of 16,100 km (8,700 nmi) and a 319 t (703,200 lb) MTOW.

    <p>
        <b>On 15 January 2015, the initial A350-900 entered service with Qatar Airways,</b> <br>
        <i>followed by the A350-1000 on 24 February 2018 with the same launch customer.</i> <br>
        <u>Singapore Airlines is currently the largest operator with 56 airplanes in its fleet.</u> <br>
        <em>As of November 2021, A350 orders stood at 913 aircraft, of which 445 had been delivered and all were in service with 39 operators.</em> <br>
        <strong>It succeeds the A340 and is positioned to compete against Boeing's large long-haul twinjets: the 787, the 777, and its successor, the 777X.</strong> <br>
    </p>

    <hr>
    Airbus initially rejected Boeing's claim that the Boeing 787 Dreamliner would be a serious threat to the Airbus A330, stating that the 787 was just a reaction to the A330 and that no response was needed.
